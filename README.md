## Overview

### The challenge


The 2022 World Cup is right upon us, so I decided to create a simulator to it. I wanted to challenge myself, so I tried some things that I had never done before.
The application is divided in two main parts: The group stage and the knockout stage.

For the group stage I've used drag and drop for the user select the winner. This functionality was pretty fun to implement.
For the knockout, the issue was to create a responsive design that worked well. I couldn't find a design for both desktops and mobile, so I divided them into two saparete problems. This approach worked very well.

When you choose a winner, you'll be able to see all the years that your choice has won the world cup. If you click on the year, you'll be redirected to Fifa's website.
